# ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in an error. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to handle this exception.

## Bug

The `bug.py` file attempts to divide 10 by 0, which causes a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a runtime error that occurs when the program attempts to perform an operation that is mathematically undefined.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates a better way of handling this type of error by checking for division by zero before the operation is performed. If the denominator is zero, the program handles the case gracefully. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more robust solution.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `bug.py` file using Python interpreter to see the error.
4. Run the `bugSolution.py` file to see how the error is handled.
